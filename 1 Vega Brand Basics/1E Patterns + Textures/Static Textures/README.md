# Static
Plain background colours would be too... static? Here are some variations.
  
## Dark
![Dark](Dark%20Grey%20Static.jpg)
  
## Middle
![Middle](Mid%20Grey%20Static.jpg)
  
## Light
![Light](Light%20Grey%20Static.jpg)

If static is too subtle, you could use [noise instead](../Noise%20Pattern/).
